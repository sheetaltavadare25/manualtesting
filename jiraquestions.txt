1) What is Jira?
Jira is a software testing tool developed by an Australian company, i.e., Atlassian.
It is a bug tracking tool used to track the issues and bugs related to your software and Mobile apps.
The name "Jira" comes from the Japanese word "Gojira", which means Godzilla.
Jira is based on Agile methodology, and the current version of Jira is 6.
2) Explain Jira workflow.
Jira workflow is a set of activities performed to track and transition of an issue during the lifecycle of an issue where transition represents the link between the two statuses when an issue moves from one status to another status, and status determines the impact of the work on an issue filed by the tester.

The following are the phases that occur in a workflow:

TODO
In Progress
Done
The Jira workflow is known as defect lifecycle or bug lifecycle. The bug lifecycle consists of the following phases:

Open issue
When the issue is created by the tester, then the issue is assigned to the software developer, and they start working on it.
In Progress
This is the phase where the software developers start working on the issue.
Resolved issue
When the issue is resolved by the software developer and waiting for the verification by the software tester. If the verification is successful, then the issue is closed; otherwise, the issue gets reopened.
Reopened issue
If the verification is unsuccessful, then the issue is reopened and assigned to the software developer.
Close issue
If the verification of the fixed bug is successful, then the issue is closed by the tester.
3) Explain the report types generated by Jira.
Jira is a defect tracking tool that creates different reports which allow you to get an overview of the current status of a project.

JIRA report is a pictorial representation of the current status of a project in the form of charts, line-charts, bar-graphs, etc.
